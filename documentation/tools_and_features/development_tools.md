    # 3. Code analysis
    lint_results = await run_code_analysis(project_path)
    
    # 4. Run tests
    test_results = await execute_tests(project_path)
    
    # 5. Build project
    build_results = await build_project(project_path)
    
    # 6. Generate reports
    await generate_development_report({
        'lint': lint_results,
        'tests': test_results, 
        'build': build_results
    })
```

### Code Quality Assessment
```python
# Comprehensive code quality check
async def assess_code_quality(project_path):
    # Static analysis
    static_analysis = await run_static_analysis(project_path)
    
    # Security scanning
    security_scan = await scan_security_vulnerabilities(project_path)
    
    # Test coverage
    coverage_report = await generate_coverage_report(project_path)
    
    # Complexity metrics
    complexity_metrics = await calculate_complexity_metrics(project_path)
    
    return {
        'quality_score': calculate_quality_score(static_analysis),
        'security_issues': security_scan['issues'],
        'coverage_percentage': coverage_report['percentage'],
        'complexity': complexity_metrics
    }
```

### Multi-Language Project Support
```python
# Handle projects with multiple languages
async def analyze_multi_language_project(project_path):
    languages = await detect_project_languages(project_path)
    
    results = {}
    for language in languages:
        results[language] = await run_language_specific_tools(
            project_path, 
            language
        )
    
    return results
```
