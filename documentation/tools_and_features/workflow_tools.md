# Workflow Tools

The Workflow Tools module provides automated workflow management, task orchestration, and CI/CD pipeline capabilities for streamlined development and deployment processes within the MCP Docker environment.

## Overview

Workflow Tools enable you to:

- Create and manage automated workflows
- Orchestrate complex multi-step tasks
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Schedule recurring tasks
- Manage task dependencies
- Monitor workflow execution
- Handle error recovery and retries

## Core Workflow Capabilities

### Workflow Management

#### Workflow Definition
Workflows are defined using declarative configuration that specifies:
- Task sequences and dependencies
- Conditional execution logic
- Error handling and retry policies
- Resource requirements
- Timeout configurations

#### Workflow Types
- **Sequential Workflows**: Tasks executed in order
- **Parallel Workflows**: Tasks executed concurrently
- **Conditional Workflows**: Tasks executed based on conditions
- **Event-Driven Workflows**: Triggered by external events
- **Scheduled Workflows**: Executed on a schedule

### Task Orchestration

#### Task Management
```python
# Example workflow definition
workflow_config = {
    "name": "development_pipeline",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "name": "code_analysis",
            "type": "analysis",
            "container": "python:3.11",
            "command": "pylint src/",
            "timeout": 300
        },
        {
            "name": "run_tests", 
            "type": "test",
            "container": "python:3.11",
            "command": "pytest tests/",
            "depends_on": ["code_analysis"],
            "timeout": 600
        },
        {
            "name": "build_package",
            "type": "build", 
            "container": "python:3.11",
            "command": "python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel",
            "depends_on": ["run_tests"],
            "timeout": 300
        }
    ]
}
```
