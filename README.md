## üîß Installation

### ONLY OPTION: Docker Installation (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**


- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Node JS and `npx` installed
** Install
This creates three services:
- `devdocs` - Documentation server
- `devdocs-sync` - Documentation synchronization
- `mcpdocker` - Main MCP server with Docker integration


**Installation**


To install this server, please edit the `compose.yml` to your ideal system. It contains a bunch of commented out services or features and more.
Then, install the docker compose server using one command:
```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
